This is the React project based on [an open-source chat platform](https://github.com/stuyy/chat-platform-react). 




# ðŸ”§ How to Install
Before you try to run this project locally, you must have both React&NestJS project, as well as  a SQL database. If you want to look up the back end repository, [click here](https://github.com/call203/chatapp-nest)

1. Clone this repository and install all dependencies.
2. Run backend projects.
3. Run React project using `npm run start`
4. The main routes are:
- `/register` to create the account
- `/login` to login to the app
- `/conversation` is where all the magic happens
